#  Use "\n" for a line break, ensure that new line is not empty, e.g. "\n \n " instead of "\n\n"
#  Keys and their translation can be removed fully to always fall back to the defaults (you can wipe the file aswell)
#  To remove a message (not send it at all), keep the key and set to blank, e.g. joinMessage: ''
#  Keys are not automatically added when new ones are added to the bot
